  you will see me. Who knows? But what does it mean? PRSNWLT? Okay, okay..I will tell you guys. If you've made it this far and watching this 
delicous Augenkrebs right here you have to be rewarded. So yeah...prsn_wlt means: Prison Wallet..(Asshole). Here is a top definition
from the Urban Dictonary: <blockquote>Prison wallet
  The anal cavity of a convict, used to store valued possessions like drugs and weapons. Keistering is the fine art of stashing and withdrawing items from the prison wallet.
  "How'd he get that shit past security?
  Easy, he just stashed it in his prison wallet."
